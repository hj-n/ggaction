# ggaction

`ggaction` is a JavaScript library for representing chart authoring as immutable,
traceable actions.

The first vertical slice is implemented: immutable programs, hierarchical
action traces, the three authoring primitives, and a Canvas renderer for
concrete `canvas` and `circle` graphics.

```javascript
import { chart } from "ggaction";

const program = chart().createCanvas({
  width: 640,
  height: 400,
  margin: { top: 30, right: 30, bottom: 60, left: 70 },
  background: "white"
});
```

See the runnable [cars scatterplot example](./examples/cars-scatterplot/),
which renders 392 rows from `data/cars.json` through the low-level extension
API. Domain-specific chart actions will be added in later steps.

Completed programs can also be exported directly in Node.js:

```javascript
import { renderToPNG } from "ggaction/png";

await renderToPNG(program, {
  output: "./output/chart.png",
  pixelRatio: 2
});
```

## Development

```bash
npm test
npm run test:render
```
