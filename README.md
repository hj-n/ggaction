# ggaction

`ggaction` is a JavaScript library for building charts through immutable,
traceable actions.

```javascript
import { chart, render } from "ggaction";

const program = chart()
  .createCanvas({
    width: 640,
    height: 400,
    margin: { top: 30, right: 30, bottom: 60, left: 70 }
  })
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createPointMark()
  .encodeX({ field: "Horsepower" })
  .encodeY({ field: "Miles_per_Gallon" })
  .encodeColor({ field: "Origin" })
  .encodeRadius({ value: 3 })
  .createGuides({
    axes: {
      x: { title: { text: "Horsepower" } },
      y: { title: { text: "Miles per Gallon" } }
    }
  });

render(program, document.querySelector("#chart").getContext("2d"));
```

The renderer reads only fully materialized, backend-neutral graphics. Semantic
state is never automatically compiled during rendering.

> **Status:** `0.0.1` is the first public release candidate. The package is not
> published to npm until the release checks and approval gate complete.

The runnable [cars scatterplot](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-scatterplot/),
[aggregate line chart](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-line-chart/), and
[stacked histogram](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-histogram/) use `data/cars.json`. The
[regression scatterplot](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-regression-scatterplot/) also uses the
cars data and layers grouped fits with confidence bands. The [grouped bar
chart](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/jobs-grouped-bar/) uses `data/jobs.json`. The [density area
chart](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-density-area/) derives grouped Acceleration
distributions from the cars data. The [error-bar chart](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-error-bar/)
summarizes mean Acceleration with 95% confidence intervals. The
[error-band chart](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/gapminder-error-band/) summarizes grouped
confidence intervals as closed area paths over time.
The [box plot](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/cars-box-plot/) supports vertical or horizontal
Tukey/min–max ranges, configurable factor and component appearance, and
optional outlier rendering from categorical and quantitative field pairs.
The [mark-selection example](https://github.com/hj-n/ggaction/tree/main/examples/mark-selection/) compares grouped point,
complete stacked-bar, and line-series highlighting through one selector grammar.
Completed programs can also be exported through
[`ggaction/png`](https://hyeonword.com/ggaction/api/rendering/#png-output).
