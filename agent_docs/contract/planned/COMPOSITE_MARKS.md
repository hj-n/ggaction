# Planned Composite Mark contracts

These accepted contracts define future aggregate mark APIs. They are not current public behavior.

## Shared interval notation

```typescript
type IntervalChannel =
  | {
      field: FieldName;
      center?: "mean" | "median";
      extent?: "stderr" | "stdev" | "ci" | "iqr";
      level?: UnitIntervalExclusive;
    }
  | {
      center: FieldName;
      lower: FieldName;
      upper: FieldName;
    };

type PositionChannel = {
  field?: FieldName;
  fieldType?: FieldType;
  scale?: PositionScale;
};

```

These types are reused below by the remaining planned interval composites. The current
`createErrorBar` contract, including horizontal and explicit intervals, lives in
[`../current/STATISTICS.md`](../current/STATISTICS.md#createerrorbar).

## createBoxPlot

```typescript
createBoxPlot({
  id?: UserId;
  target?: UserId;
  data?: UserId;
  x?: PositionChannel;
  y?: PositionChannel;
  coordinate?: UserId;
  whisker?: BoxWhisker;
  width?: { band: UnitIntervalExclusive };
  outliers?: boolean;
  box?: {
    fill?: NonEmptyString;
    opacity?: UnitInterval;
    stroke?: NonEmptyString;
    strokeWidth?: NonNegativeFinite;
  };
  median?: {
    stroke?: NonEmptyString;
    strokeWidth?: NonNegativeFinite;
  };
  outlier?: {
    shape?: PointShape;
    radius?: PositiveFinite;
    opacity?: UnitInterval;
  };
}): ChartProgram;
```

- One positional channel is categorical and the other is quantitative; vertical and horizontal orientation
  are inferred from that pair. With omitted channels, `target` selects an existing compatible encoded layer,
  otherwise the normal current-then-unique eligible-layer rule applies. Data, coordinate and compatible scales
  are reused from that source. Unsupported or ambiguous combinations fail instead of choosing an orientation
  arbitrarily.
- The completed contract is authoring-order independent. Compatible x/y encodings may exist before
  `createBoxPlot`, or `createBoxPlot` may establish its owner before later `encodeX`/`encodeY` calls. The latter
  stores materialization intent without synthetic summary rows or placeholder components, then rematerializes
  when the required data and channel roles are complete. Both orders must converge on identical semantic and
  graphical state; ambiguous targets remain errors.
- Internal wrapped data actions create the immutable summary and optional outlier datasets. The aggregate then
  composes: `createErrorBar` in explicit whisker mode, a ranged `createBarMark` for q1→q3, a
  `createRuleMark` for the median, and optional `createPointMark` outliers.
- The bar layer reuses Current `encodeYRange` or `encodeXRange`; this extends ranged position materialization
  to bars without adding a box-specific range channel. `width.band` defaults to `0.7` and remains graphical
  mark configuration.
- `whisker` defaults to Tukey factor `1.5`; `outliers` defaults to `true` for Tukey and has no effect in minmax
  mode. Concrete order is whiskers/caps behind the box, then median, then outliers.
- `width.band` defaults to `0.7`. Box defaults are fill/stroke `#4c78a8`, opacity `1`, stroke width `1.5`;
  median defaults are stroke `#1f2937`, width `2`; whiskers/caps default to black `#111111`, width `2`, and
  outliers default to black diamond, radius-equivalent area from `3`, opacity `0.75`.
  Median span follows the concrete box body extent, while reused error-bar caps keep their 8px logical default.
- Omitted `id` resolves once to `"boxPlot"`; a second box plot requires an explicit ID. Child IDs and datasets
  are namespaced from the resolved owner. The aggregate is create-only; users modify stable child
  marks through their assignment actions rather than through `editBoxPlot`. Missing categorical combinations
  are not synthesized.
- Phase 8 does not accept an additional `groupBy`. The categorical position already owns the statistical
  partition; subgroup offset/color/layout remains outside this initial contract.
- Status: Planned, NOT IMPLEMENTED. both orientations, Tukey/minmax, width/outlier/style options, empty and
  sparse groups, ranged bars, child edits, ordering, trace, rematerialization and browser/PNG parity가 필요하다.
