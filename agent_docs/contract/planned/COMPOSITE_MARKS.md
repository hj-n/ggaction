# Planned Composite Mark contracts

These accepted contracts define future aggregate mark APIs. They are not current public behavior.

## Shared interval notation

```typescript
type IntervalChannel =
  | {
      field: FieldName;
      center?: "mean" | "median";
      extent?: "stderr" | "stdev" | "ci" | "iqr";
      level?: UnitIntervalExclusive;
    }
  | {
      center: FieldName;
      lower: FieldName;
      upper: FieldName;
    };

type PositionChannel = {
  field: FieldName;
  fieldType: FieldType;
  scale?: PositionScale;
};

```

These types are reused below by the remaining planned interval composites. The current
`createErrorBar` contract, including horizontal and explicit intervals, lives in
[`../current/STATISTICS.md`](../current/STATISTICS.md#createerrorbar).

## createErrorBand

Vertical statistical/explicit y intervals, temporal/quantitative x, grouping, fill/opacity, source inference and
ordinary area composition are Current in [`../current/STATISTICS.md`](../current/STATISTICS.md#createerrorband).
This section owns only the accepted horizontal, curve, and boundary remainder.

```typescript
createErrorBand({
  id?: UserId;
  target?: UserId;
  data?: UserId;
  x?: PositionChannel | IntervalChannel;
  y?: PositionChannel | IntervalChannel;
  groupBy?: FieldName;
  coordinate?: UserId;
  fill?: NonEmptyString;
  opacity?: UnitInterval;
  boundaries?: false | {
    stroke?: NonEmptyString;
    strokeWidth?: NonNegativeFinite;
    strokeDash?: DashPattern;
    opacity?: UnitInterval;
    curve?: CurveInterpolation;
  };
  curve?: CurveInterpolation;
}): ChartProgram;
```

- `id` defaults to `"errorBand"` only while that owner is unique. A second band must provide an explicit ID.
  When x or y is omitted, `target` selects an existing compatible encoded layer; otherwise the normal
  current-then-unique eligible-layer rule applies. Ambiguity is an error. The inferred source contributes its
  data, coordinate, position scales and grouping, and every resolved resource is persisted.
- x/y interval selection and optional `createIntervalData` are identical to `createErrorBar`. Explicit mode
  consumes existing center/lower/upper fields; the center field is retained for provenance and optional
  downstream use even though band geometry uses lower/upper bounds. When both positions are quantitative, a
  statistical interval must be distinguished by an interval option or an explicit lower/upper triple instead
  of being guessed.
- The aggregate calls `createAreaMark`, the positional action for the independent channel, and
  `encodeYRange` or Planned `encodeXRange` for the interval bounds. It forwards one shared coordinate,
  scales, grouping and curve decision to every child.
- `boundaries` defaults to `false`. When present, the aggregate adds lower and upper `createLineMark` children
  with namespaced IDs and forwards the boundary style. Boundary curve inherits the band curve unless explicitly
  overridden. Rendering order is band first and boundaries second.
- Field-driven fill is intentionally not duplicated in this aggregate. Call existing `encodeColor` on the
  representative area after creation; `groupBy` controls path segmentation independently of visible color.
- The aggregate is create-only. Band appearance changes use the owned area/encoding actions and boundary
  changes use the owned line/encoding actions; no `editErrorBand` action is introduced.
- Status: Partially implemented. Vertical computed/explicit bounds, grouped paths, scale sharing,
  rematerialization, trace and renderer parity are Current. Horizontal x/x2 bounds, curve forwarding, boundary
  options/order and their variants remain Planned, NOT IMPLEMENTED.

## regression band delegation

```text
createRegression
├─ createRegressionData
├─ createRegressionBand
│  └─ createErrorBand (explicit interval mode)
└─ createRegressionLine
```

- `createRegressionBand` remains the regression-specific advanced action and compatibility boundary. It
  validates regression result provenance and shared resources, then delegates graphical composition to
  `createErrorBand` with the existing fitted/lower/upper fields.
- `createRegression` keeps its current public hierarchy and default inference. Regression-specific naming,
  confidence/method semantics and style forwarding stay owned by regression actions; generic error-band code
  does not infer regression.
- Equivalent regression programs before and after delegation must converge on the same semantic bindings,
  concrete paths, rendering order, rematerialization consumers and visible trace hierarchy.
- Status: Planned, NOT IMPLEMENTED. compatibility fixtures, grouped/ungrouped bands, style/curve forwarding,
  trace nesting, scale sharing and primitive-equivalence coverage가 필요하다.

## createBoxPlot

```typescript
createBoxPlot({
  id: UserId;
  data?: UserId;
  x: PositionChannel;
  y: PositionChannel;
  groupBy?: FieldName;
  coordinate?: UserId;
  whisker?: BoxWhisker;
  width?: { band: UnitIntervalExclusive };
  outliers?: boolean;
  box?: {
    fill?: NonEmptyString;
    opacity?: UnitInterval;
    stroke?: NonEmptyString;
    strokeWidth?: NonNegativeFinite;
  };
  median?: {
    stroke?: NonEmptyString;
    strokeWidth?: NonNegativeFinite;
  };
  outlier?: {
    shape?: PointShape;
    radius?: PositiveFinite;
    opacity?: UnitInterval;
  };
}): ChartProgram;
```

- One positional channel is categorical and the other is quantitative; vertical and horizontal orientation
  are inferred from that pair. `data` is inferred by the normal current/unique rules. Unsupported or ambiguous
  combinations fail instead of choosing an orientation arbitrarily.
- Internal wrapped data actions create the immutable summary and optional outlier datasets. The aggregate then
  composes: `createErrorBar` in explicit whisker mode, a ranged `createBarMark` for q1→q3, a
  `createRuleMark` for the median, and optional `createPointMark` outliers.
- The bar layer reuses `encodeYRange` or Planned `encodeXRange`; this extends ranged position materialization
  to bars without adding a box-specific range channel. `width.band` defaults to `0.7` and remains graphical
  mark configuration.
- `whisker` defaults to Tukey factor `1.5`; `outliers` defaults to `true` for Tukey and has no effect in minmax
  mode. Concrete order is whiskers/caps behind the box, then median, then outliers.
- Child IDs and datasets are namespaced from `id`. The aggregate is create-only; users modify stable child
  marks through their assignment actions rather than through `editBoxPlot`. Missing categorical combinations
  are not synthesized.
- Status: Planned, NOT IMPLEMENTED. both orientations, Tukey/minmax, width/outlier/style options, empty and
  sparse groups, ranged bars, child edits, ordering, trace, rematerialization and browser/PNG parity가 필요하다.

## composite ownership and storage

- No `semanticSpec.composites` registry is introduced. Each child remains an ordinary semantic layer and each
  derived dataset uses the existing dataset/provenance model.
- The user ID identifies the representative component; every repeatable child layer, dataset and graphic ID is
  deterministically namespaced by owner and role. Generated IDs remain implementation details.
- Aggregate actions orchestrate wrapped child actions and never duplicate their validation or materialization.
  They are create-only because later changes are assignments to stable child resources.
- A composite's rematerialization is the ordered, deduplicated union of its child consumer plans. Earlier
  immutable programs retain every old dataset, semantic binding and concrete graphic unchanged.
