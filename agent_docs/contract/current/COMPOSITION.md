# Current program composition actions

## `facet`

- Signature: `facet({ id?, field, data?, columns?, gap?, align?, padding?, scales?, guides? })`.
- `field` is required. Omitted `data` resolves only when every eligible repeated layer has one unique common row-preserving ancestor.
- Supported sources are complete point, histogram bar, aggregate bar, and layered point/regression programs.
- Facet values use source first-appearance order. Omitted `columns` creates one row; a positive integer wraps cells row-major.
- Omitted scale policies are shared. `x`, `y`, `xOffset`, `color`, `size`, `shape`, `opacity`, and `strokeDash`
  accept `"shared" | "independent"` when the channel is used. Explicit semantic domains override either policy.
  Histogram children share one bin-boundary set only when x is shared.
- Regression dependencies replay from each filtered cell source through `replayDerivedData`, then every affected
  layer is explicitly rebound through `rebindLayerData` before one deduplicated rematerialization plan runs.
- `guides.legend` is `false` by default. `"shared"` creates one parent-owned categorical color legend while axes remain in each cell.
- The result is a composition parent whose `children` retain immutable filtered programs and whose `graphicSpec` contains the complete namespaced nested-Canvas snapshot.
- Canonical title order is `.facet(...).createTitle(...)`. A valid title authored before `facet` is promoted once to the parent.
- Parent title alignment uses the translated child-plot union. Each facet header is centered on its own translated
  child plot; neither anchor uses the child Canvas, axis-reserved margin, facet padding, or shared legend extent.

### Formal values — `facet`

- Implemented: `facet({ id?: UserId; field: NonEmptyString; data?: ExistingRowPreservingDatasetId; columns?: PositiveInteger; gap?: NonNegativeFinite; align?: "start" | "center" | "end"; padding?: NonNegativeFinite | Partial<FourSidePadding>; scales?: Partial<Record<FacetScaleChannel, "shared" | "independent">>; guides?: { legend?: false | "shared" } }): ChartProgram`.
- Proposed (NOT IMPLEMENTED): outer-only axes and non-categorical shared legends.
- Planned (NOT YET INTEGRATED): density, interval/error-band and box dependency replay, outer-only axes, and
  non-categorical shared legends.
- Current limitation: Polar channels, remaining statistical transform families, outer-only axes, and
  non-categorical shared legends are not implemented in public facet composition.

### Value coverage — `facet`

- ✅ Covered: source and value inference, explicit common ancestor, one-row and wrapped layout,
  point/histogram/aggregate-bar eligibility, regression dependency replay, shared/independent continuous domains,
  explicit-domain precedence, shared ordinal order, shared/independent histogram policy, parent categorical legend,
  title promotion, child-plot-aligned parent title and headers, renderer isolation, immutable base/children, invalid
  channel, dependency, and ambiguous-source rejection.

  `test/unit/actions/composition/facet.test.js`, `test/gates/direct-source-facet/public.test.js`,
  `test/gates/facet-resolution/public.test.js`.

## `editFacetHeaders`

- Signature: `editFacetHeaders({ fontSize?, fontFamily?, fontWeight?, color?, offset? })`.
- Requires a facet composition and at least one appearance change.
- Headers are one parent-owned repeated concrete resource. Each header is centered on its child plot bounds. Editing
  them preserves child identity, semantic facet values, shared scales, and layout order, then rematerializes the
  parent snapshot.

### Formal values — `editFacetHeaders`

- Implemented: `editFacetHeaders({ fontSize?: PositiveFinite; fontFamily?: NonEmptyString; fontWeight?: NonEmptyString | Finite; color?: NonEmptyString; offset?: NonNegativeFinite }): ChartProgram`.
- Proposed (NOT IMPLEMENTED): —

### Value coverage — `editFacetHeaders`

- ✅ Covered: child-plot centering, partial edit, immutable prior state, layout-edit convergence, empty edit rejection,
  and non-facet rejection.
- Evidence: `test/unit/actions/composition/facet.test.js`, `test/gates/direct-source-facet/public.test.js`.

## `editCompositionLayout`

- Signature: `editCompositionLayout({ gap?, align?, padding? })`.
- Requires an existing composition program and at least one layout option.
- `gap`: non-negative finite distance between adjacent child slots.
- `align`: `"start" | "center" | "end"` on the cross axis.
- `padding`: a non-negative scalar for all sides or a partial `{ top?, right?, bottom?, left? }` patch.
- Effect: preserves the ordered child IDs and child program references, then rebuilds the complete parent snapshot
  from canonical child state. Omitted options preserve current values.
- Facet compositions use the same action for gap, alignment, and padding. Their derived children and value order are
  retained; `columns` is structural facet intent and is not edited by this action.

### Formal values — `editCompositionLayout`

- Implemented: `editCompositionLayout({ gap?: NonNegativeFinite; align?: "start" | "center" | "end"; padding?: NonNegativeFinite | Partial<FourSidePadding> }): ChartProgram`.
- Proposed (NOT IMPLEMENTED): —

### Value coverage — `editCompositionLayout`

- ✅ Covered: scalar and partial padding, every alignment, gap, child preservation, immutable earlier program,
  complete rematerialization, facet compatibility, and invalid option rejection.
- Evidence: `test/unit/actions/composition/concat.test.js`, `test/unit/actions/composition/facet.test.js`,
  `test/gates/program-composition/public.test.js`.

## `replaceCompositionChild`

- Signature: `replaceCompositionChild({ target, program })`.
- `target`: one existing child slot ID.
- `program`: one complete unit or nested composition `ChartProgram` with no unfinished action stack.
- Effect: preserves the target ID, slot order and all sibling references, replaces only the named child, then
  rebuilds the complete parent snapshot. The child program itself remains immutable and is retained by reference.
- Facet children are derived from one canonical source and cannot be replaced through this action.

### Formal values — `replaceCompositionChild`

- Implemented: `replaceCompositionChild({ target: UserId; program: CompleteChartProgram }): ChartProgram`.
- Proposed (NOT IMPLEMENTED): —

### Value coverage — `replaceCompositionChild`

- ✅ Covered: unit replacement, nested-child eligibility, slot/order preservation, immutable source and sibling
  identity, namespaced snapshot rebuilding, unknown target and incomplete child rejection.
- Evidence: `test/unit/actions/composition/concat.test.js`, `test/gates/program-composition/public.test.js`,
  `test/gates/program-composition/png.render.js`.
