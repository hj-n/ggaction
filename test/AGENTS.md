# Test Instructions

Apply these instructions to tests, fixtures, examples, generated artifacts, and test infrastructure in addition to the repository root instructions.

## Scoped Test Instructions

- Read `test/charts/AGENTS.md` for public chart programs, primitive baselines, PNG regressions, visual manifests, and chart slices.
- Read `test/browser/AGENTS.md` for browser examples, Playwright harnesses, Canvas readiness, and browser accessibility checks.
- Read `test/contracts/AGENTS.md` for architecture, package-boundary, coverage, discovery, and inventory contracts.
- Apply every relevant nested file when one test change crosses several evidence layers. Do not copy one rule into several scopes.

## Suite-Wide Rules

- Write source code, test descriptions, fixtures, and example programs in English. Korean is reserved for implementation collaboration documents.
- Organize tests by reusable capability and contract owner, not roadmap, Phase, Gate, or a mechanically mirrored source tree.
- Keep development history out of durable suite names, selectors, manifests, artifact paths, and descriptions.
- Do not make stable tests depend on roadmap plans, Gate records, or closeout prose. Move durable assertions to current contracts, source, declarations, examples, or concrete output.
- Use `.test.js` for the normal suite and `.render.js` for expensive renderer regressions. Test discovery must select both intentionally and never discover helpers as tests.
- Keep every JavaScript test module reachable from a discovered suite, render entry, browser entry, or HTML module script. Unreachable helpers and fixtures are dead test code.
- Put reusable expected-value algorithms in `test/oracles/` and keep them independent from `src/`. Anchor each oracle with representative literal expectations.
- Pair representative examples or images with focused semantic, geometric, mathematical, package, and architecture assertions. Visual output alone is not sufficient evidence.
- Pair fixed numeric cases with invariants such as monotonicity, conservation, non-negativity, interval containment, and stable ordering for continuous or statistical behavior.
- Match coverage to the affected layer: pure numeric oracles for computation, state and order assertions for structure, concrete properties plus rematerialization for geometry/style, and pixels only for representative visual differences.
- Split a large test module by contract owner or lifecycle concern, not an arbitrary line target. Keep explicit primitive programs, declarative manifests, and independent oracles intact.

## Active Review Gates

- Use `test/gates/<chart>/` only for an active, unapproved visual slice. It must contain an executable primitive, reference values, manifest, normal tests, and render test.
- Stable charts, contracts, browser tests, and examples must never import from `test/gates/`. When no review is active, the directory has no executable slice and tooling must tolerate its absence in a clean checkout.
- After visual approval and public implementation, move the complete slice to its stable capability location and remove the Gate directory and review artifacts.
- Never leave skipped or placeholder public tests in `test/charts/`, and never encode roadmap or completed Gate identity in approved tests or artifacts.
