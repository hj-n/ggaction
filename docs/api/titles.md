# Titles

{% include chart-example.html id="line" %}

## At a glance

| Action | Shortest call | Inference/defaults | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `createTitle` | `createTitle({ text: "Title" })` | Top, plot-left alignment, default styles | Semantic text and concrete title graphics |
| `editTitle` | `editTitle({ position: "bottom" })` | Preserves omitted text, layout, wrapping, and style | Rematerialized title graphics |

## `createTitle(options)`

Creates one chart title and an optional subtitle on any Canvas edge.

```javascript
program.createTitle({
  text: "The trend of acceleration by year",
  subtitle: "from 1970 to 1982"
});
```

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | non-empty string | required |
| `subtitle` | non-empty string | omitted |
| `position` | `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, or `"right"` | `"top"` |
| `align` | `"left"`, `"center"`, or `"right"` | `"left"` |
| `offset` | finite number | `0` |
| `gap` | non-negative number | `8` |
| `maxWidth` | positive number | omitted; no wrapping |
| `wrap` | `"word"` or `"character"` | `"word"` when `maxWidth` is set |
| `lineHeight` | positive number | each font size × `1.2` |
| `titleStyle` | text style object | default title style |
| `subtitleStyle` | text style object | default subtitle style |

Both style objects accept `color`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, and `fontWeight`.
The defaults are:

```javascript
{
  titleStyle: {
    color: "#0f172a",
    fontSize: 22,
    fontFamily: "sans-serif",
    fontWeight: 600
  },
  subtitleStyle: {
    color: "#64748b",
    fontSize: 14,
    fontFamily: "sans-serif",
    fontWeight: "normal"
  }
}
```

## Position, alignment, and wrapping

Alignment uses the plot bounds rather than the full Canvas: left aligns with
the plot's left edge, center with its midpoint, and right with its right edge.
For a left or right title, the same values mean the top, center, and bottom of
the plot edge. Left titles rotate counter-clockwise and right titles rotate
clockwise; top and bottom titles remain horizontal.

Set `maxWidth` to wrap text before edge rotation. Word wrapping prefers
whitespace and falls back to Unicode-safe character wrapping for an oversized
word. Character wrapping always splits on Unicode code-point boundaries. The
library uses deterministic text metrics so the same program produces the same
line breaks in browsers and Node. Renderers draw the concrete lines already in
`graphicSpec`; they do not wrap text again. Explicit newline characters are
not accepted.

The requested margin must contain the actual title block. A title must also
avoid guides reserved on the same edge. Creation fails instead of expanding
the Canvas, changing margins, or moving the title automatically.

## `editTitle(options)`

Partially edits the existing title. At least one option is required.

```javascript
const edited = program.editTitle({
  position: "bottom",
  align: "center",
  maxWidth: 280,
  titleStyle: { fontSize: 20 }
});
```

Omitted properties remain unchanged, and style objects merge only the supplied
leaves. `text` and string `subtitle` replace semantic text. Use
`subtitle: false` to remove the subtitle; a later string recreates it.
Wrapping and layout changes rebuild the concrete text lines without changing
unrelated chart state.

## Stored result

The title and subtitle strings are stored in `semanticSpec`. Alignment,
spacing, wrapping configuration, and text appearance are graphical state.
Resolved line breaks, coordinates, and rotations are concrete text graphics.
Canvas size and margin changes explicitly rematerialize their positions.

## Errors and limitations

The library supports one title and one optional subtitle. `wrap` and
`lineHeight` require `maxWidth`; explicit `lineHeight` must cover every visible
font size. Missing margin space and same-edge guide collisions are errors.
