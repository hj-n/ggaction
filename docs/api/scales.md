# Scale Options

## At a glance

| Scale family | Default domain | Default range | Common controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linear/time position | `"auto"` | Plot bounds | `nice`, `zero` |
| Ordinal position/xOffset | First-appearance order | Plot or parent band | explicit domain/range |
| Color/strokeDash | First-appearance order | Built-in palette/patterns | palette or explicit range |

Encoding actions accept a nested `scale` object. Omitted properties use channel
defaults and stored program state.

Existing scales can be changed with `editScale`:

```javascript
const reversed = program.editScale({ id: "x", reverse: true });
```

`id` may be omitted when the current scale or the program's only scale is
unambiguous. At least one of `domain`, `range`, `nice`, `zero`, `clamp`, or
`reverse` is required. Use `"auto"` to reset domain or range; omission preserves
the current value.

## Continuous scales

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | scale ID | channel name |
| `type` | `"linear"` or `"time"` | inferred from channel and field type |
| `domain` | `"auto"` or two values | `"auto"` |
| `range` | `"auto"` or two finite numbers | `"auto"` |
| `nice` | boolean | omitted |
| `zero` | boolean | omitted; linear only |

Automatic ranges use current plot bounds. For automatic linear domains,
`zero: true` includes zero and `nice: true` then expands to rounded boundaries.
Automatic temporal `nice` expands to UTC calendar boundaries. Time scales
reject `zero`.

The precedence is:

```text
explicit domain > nice / zero > inferred domain
reverse(explicit range > inferred range)
```

`clamp: true` constrains values outside a linear or time domain to the nearest
range endpoint. `reverse: true` reverses the final resolved range. Ordinal
scales support `reverse` but reject `nice`, `zero`, and `clamp`.

### Binned bar x scales

A binned bar x encoding defaults to `nice: true` and `zero: false`. Automatic
nice bin boundaries use `1, 2, 3, 5 × 10ⁿ` steps and never create more than
`bin.maxBins` intervals. Explicit domains remain unchanged; `nice` and `zero`
do not expand them.

The resolved scale domain contains the outer bin boundaries. Concrete bin
counts and rect geometry are materialized once count/zero-stack y is present.

A histogram count y scale defaults to `nice: true` and `zero: true`. Its
automatic domain uses total counts per x bin rather than raw source values.
The x action leaves the collection empty; the y action resolves both scales and
materializes concrete histogram rectangles.

### Aggregate ordinal bar y scales

An ordinal bar scalar-aggregate y scale defaults to `nice: true` and `zero: false`.
Its automatic domain uses one final aggregate value per ordinal x/category and
series cell rather than raw source values. Explicit domain and range values remain authoritative.
The y action resolves the scale but leaves rectangles empty until grouping
semantics are available.

## Ordinal scales

Ordinal bar x, color, and stroke-dash encodings use ordinal scales. Automatic
domains preserve first-appearance order.

An ordinal bar x scale uses `"auto"` or a numeric pair as its range. Automatic
ranges use the horizontal plot bounds. The resolved scale records one equal
`step` per domain value and an absolute `bandwidth`; category positions lie at
band centers. Reversed explicit ranges are valid. Ordinal scales reject
`nice` and `zero`.

Color ranges accept explicit colors or a named palette descriptor; stroke-dash
ranges accept named styles and direct dash patterns.

```javascript
program.encodeColor({
  field: "Origin",
  scale: {
    domain: ["USA", "Europe", "Japan"],
    range: ["#4c78a8", "#f58518", "#e45756"]
  }
});
```

User-specified domains and ranges are semantic state. Resolved coordinates,
colors, and dash patterns are stored as concrete graphical values.

### Stroke-dash ranges

The names `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, and `dashdot` resolve to `[]`, `[6, 4]`,
`[1, 3]`, and `[6, 3, 1, 3]`. A direct pattern is an empty array or an
even-length array of non-negative finite numbers that is not entirely zero.

```javascript
program.encodeStrokeDash({
  field: "Origin",
  scale: { range: ["solid", "dashed", [8, 3]] }
});
```

Semantic scale state preserves the names; the resolved scale, line paths, and
legend symbols contain numeric patterns only. Pattern lengths use logical
Canvas units and do not change with output pixel ratio.

## Named palettes

Use a name directly or an object with optional sampling controls:

```javascript
program.encodeColor({
  field: "Origin",
  scale: { palette: { name: "set2", count: 3 } }
});
```

Accepted names are fixed by the ggaction contract:

| Family | Names |
| --- | --- |
| Categorical | `accent`, `category10`, `category20`, `category20b`, `category20c`, `observable10`, `dark2`, `paired`, `pastel1`, `pastel2`, `set1`, `set2`, `set3`, `tableau10`, `tableau20` |
| Sequential | `blues`, `tealblues`, `teals`, `greens`, `browns`, `oranges`, `reds`, `purples`, `warmgreys`, `greys`, `viridis`, `magma`, `inferno`, `plasma`, `cividis`, `turbo`, `bluegreen`, `bluepurple`, `goldgreen`, `goldorange`, `goldred`, `greenblue`, `orangered`, `purplebluegreen`, `purpleblue`, `purplered`, `redpurple`, `yellowgreenblue`, `yellowgreen`, `yelloworangebrown`, `yelloworangered`, `darkblue`, `darkgold`, `darkgreen`, `darkmulti`, `darkred`, `lightgreyred`, `lightgreyteal`, `lightmulti`, `lightorange`, `lighttealblue` |
| Diverging | `blueorange`, `brownbluegreen`, `purplegreen`, `pinkyellowgreen`, `purpleorange`, `redblue`, `redgrey`, `redyellowblue`, `redyellowgreen`, `spectral` |
| Cyclical | `rainbow`, `sinebow` |

`count` must be a positive integer. Categorical palettes use a prefix when the
count is shorter and cycle deterministically when it is longer. Other families
are sampled to `count`, or to the resolved domain size when omitted. `extent`
is accepted only for non-categorical palettes and contains two distinct values
within `[0, 1]`; descending values reverse the sampling direction. Scale
`reverse` is applied afterward.

The semantic scale stores the palette descriptor. Materialized scales, marks,
legends, and renderers receive only concrete CSS colors. Explicit `range` and
`palette` cannot be supplied together.

## Continuous point color

Quantitative or temporal point color uses `fieldType: "quantitative"` or
`"temporal"` and an internal sequential scale. The default palette is
`viridis`; an explicit palette may use `extent`, while an explicit range needs
at least two colors. `interpolate` accepts `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsl-long`, `lab`,
`hcl`, `hcl-long`, `cubehelix`, or `cubehelix-long`. `clamp` and `reverse`
affect both points and a connected gradient legend.

```javascript
program.encodeColor({
  field: "Acceleration",
  fieldType: "quantitative",
  scale: { palette: "viridis", interpolate: "rgb" }
});
```

The sequential type is inferred inside `encodeColor`; it is not added to the
general direct `createScale` vocabulary.

## Errors and limitations

One scale cannot be shared across different channels. Explicit domains must
contain every observed value required by ordinal consumers. A successful edit
rematerializes connected marks and guides; a failed edit leaves the earlier
immutable program unchanged.
