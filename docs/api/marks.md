## `createPointMark({ id?, data?, shape? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first point mark defaults to `"point"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |
| `shape` | supported point shape | `"circle"` |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createPointMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `point`; a fixed shape is graphical appearance.
Circle is the default. Square uses a rect, while the remaining shapes use
backend-neutral Z-closed command paths. A later field-driven `encodeShape` converts the
mark into one typed mixed collection.
Points are not renderable until later actions assign the required position,
size, and fill properties.

Point creation normally waits for position encodings. When it is added after
one current compatible layer, omitted data, coordinate, and x/y encodings are
inferred and persisted. The new point reuses the existing scales but does not
copy mark-specific aggregate, bin, or stack policies. Ambiguous sources require
explicit authoring.

The first omitted mark ID uses its semantic role: `"point"`, `"line"`,
`"bar"`, `"area"`, or `"rule"`. A second mark of the same type requires an explicit ID.
This keeps simple chains concise without creating hidden numbered resources.

## `editPointMark({ target?, shape?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth? })`

Change a point mark's constant shape or outline appearance without changing its
data or encodings:

```javascript
const diamonds = program.editPointMark({
  target: "points",
  shape: "diamond",
  fill: "#2563eb",
  opacity: 0.72,
  stroke: "#ffffff",
  strokeWidth: 0.6
});
```

`target` may be omitted when the current or only point mark is unambiguous.
Supported shapes are `circle`, `square`, `diamond`, the four directional
triangles, `plus`, `cross`, `star`, `hexagon`, and `wye`. All recipes preserve
the same logical target area. A constant edit is rejected when the mark already
has a field-driven shape encoding. Constant `fill` is rejected when a semantic
color encoding already owns point color.
`opacity` is between `0` and `1`; `strokeWidth` is a non-negative finite logical
pixel value. At least one editable property is required, and omitted properties
are preserved through later position rematerialization.

## `createAreaMark({ id?, data?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth?, curve? } = {})`

Create a semantic area mark backed by an initially empty path collection.
`data` defaults to current data, `fill` defaults to `"#4c78a8"`, and opacity
defaults to `0.2`. The fixed fill and opacity are graphical appearance.
`stroke` adds a constant path outline; its width defaults to `1`. A width without
a stroke is rejected.

`curve` uses the same `linear`, `step`, `step-before`, `step-after`, `basis`,
`cardinal`, `monotone`, and `natural` vocabulary as line marks. It defaults to
`linear`. The lower and upper edges are interpolated independently before the
path is connected and closed, so the connector is never smoothed as data.

An area becomes renderable after exactly one ranged orientation exists:
quantitative or temporal x with quantitative `encodeYRange`, or quantitative
`encodeXRange` with quantitative or temporal y. Optional `encodeGroup` creates one Z-closed filled path per
nominal group without creating a scale or legend. A density-derived dataset may
instead use value/density x and y encodings: the density axis is closed against
zero, while the value axis determines sample order. Both horizontal-density and
vertical-density orientations are supported.

## `editAreaMark({ target?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth?, curve? })`

Edit constant area appearance without changing data, fields, grouping, scales,
or coordinates:

```javascript
const outlined = program.editAreaMark({
  target: "densities",
  opacity: 0.35,
  stroke: "#334155",
  strokeWidth: 1.5,
  curve: "cardinal"
});
```

The current or only compatible area is inferred when `target` is omitted.
`stroke: false` removes both the outline and its stored width. A width-only edit
requires an active outline. Constant `fill` cannot replace a field-driven color
encoding, while opacity and outline remain independently editable. Complete
areas rematerialize immediately; incomplete areas retain the graphical config.
Changing `curve` preserves the area's data, fields, scales, grouping, and
appearance while replacing its concrete path commands.

## `createLineMark({ id?, data?, strokeWidth?, curve? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first line mark defaults to `"line"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |
| `strokeWidth` | non-negative finite number | materializer default `2` |
| `curve` | supported curve interpolation | `"linear"` |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createLineMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `line`. Its graphical realization starts as an empty
`path` collection because series cardinality depends on later grouping
encodings rather than raw dataset length.

```javascript
program.graphicSpec.objects.line;
// { type: "path", items: [] }
```

Line mark creation does not infer one default series, coordinates, encodings,
or path commands. Temporal `encodeX` resolves the horizontal scale while leaving
the collection empty. Aggregate line `encodeY` then derives the currently known
series, resizes the collection, and materializes sorted concrete commands.
`encodeColor` and `encodeStrokeDash` can further regroup those paths and apply
semantic series styles. Regression-derived quantitative x/y values may be
materialized directly without temporal aggregation.

`curve` accepts `linear`, `step`, `step-before`, `step-after`, `basis`,
`cardinal`, `monotone`, and `natural`. Linear and step curves materialize `L`
commands; smooth curves materialize cubic `C` commands. Smooth curves with only
two points fall back to linear. A monotone curve requires strictly increasing
materialized x values.

## `editLineMark({ target?, strokeWidth?, curve? })`

Edit line appearance without changing fields, grouping, coordinates, or scales:

```javascript
const smooth = program.editLineMark({
  target: "trends",
  curve: "monotone",
  strokeWidth: 4
});
```

`target` may be omitted for the current or only line mark. At least one of
`strokeWidth` and `curve` is required. A complete line is rematerialized
immediately; an incomplete line retains the choice until its encodings make it
renderable. Canvas resizing and later series regrouping preserve both settings.

## `createBarMark({ id?, data? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first bar mark defaults to `"bar"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createBarMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `bar`. Its graphical realization starts as an empty
`rect` collection because binning, aggregation, stacking, and optional grouping
determine the eventual rectangle count.

```javascript
program.graphicSpec.objects.bar;
// { type: "rect", items: [] }
```

Bar mark creation does not assign coordinates, encodings, bins, or concrete
rectangles. A subsequent binned `encodeX` can store the horizontal histogram
meaning and resolve its scale. `encodeY()` then infers count/zero-stack meaning
and resolves its scale, then materializes one concrete rectangle per non-empty
bin.

A bar can instead represent an observed interval. Give it a nominal or ordinal
category on one axis, use `encodeYRange({ lower, upper })` or
`encodeXRange({ lower, upper })` on the other, and set thickness with
`encodeBarWidth`. The secondary endpoint removes stale aggregate/stack intent;
both endpoints share one scale and Canvas edits rematerialize the rectangles.

`encodeColor({ field, layout? })` can then split each non-empty bin into category
rects. The color scale domain controls series order. Stack uses total bin counts,
fill normalizes to one, group creates within-bin slots, overlay shares a baseline,
and diverging separates positive and negative accumulation.

## `editBarMark({ target?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth? })`

Edit the appearance of every rectangle owned by one bar mark:

```javascript
const outlined = program.editBarMark({
  target: "bars",
  opacity: 0.8,
  stroke: "#111827",
  strokeWidth: 1.5
});
```

The current or only bar is inferred when `target` is omitted. At least one
appearance option is required. `stroke: false` removes the visible outline;
a later string stroke restores it. A constant `fill` conflicts with a
field-driven color encoding, while opacity and outline remain editable.
Histogram, aggregate, grouped, and ranged geometry and semantics are unchanged,
and the appearance is reapplied after Canvas or scale rematerialization.

## `createRuleMark({ id?, data? } = {})`

Create a semantic rule mark backed by an empty backend-neutral `line`
collection. The first omitted ID is `"rule"`; `data` defaults to current data.
Creation assigns no position or style.

Use `encodeX` or `encodeY` for a full plot-span rule. Add `encodeY2` for a
bounded vertical interval, `encodeX2` for a bounded horizontal interval, or
both secondary endpoints for a diagonal rule. Each endpoint accepts either a
field or a datum. Constant stroke and width use `encodeStroke` and
`encodeStrokeWidth`; dash and opacity reuse their existing encoding actions.

Every complete rule is stored as concrete `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` values.
An incomplete intermediate endpoint combination stays empty until a later
assignment completes it. Canvas and scale edits recompute all endpoints.

## Errors and limitations

Mark IDs must be unique and the selected dataset must exist. If a mark type
already exists, another mark of that type requires an explicit ID. Current
semantic marks are point, line, bar, area, and rule; additional mark types are not
implemented.
