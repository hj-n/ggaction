## `createPointMark({ id?, data?, shape? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first point mark defaults to `"point"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |
| `shape` | supported point shape | `"circle"` |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createPointMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `point`; a fixed shape is graphical appearance.
Circle is the default. Square uses a rect, while the remaining shapes use
backend-neutral Z-closed command paths. A later field-driven `encodeShape` converts the
mark into one typed mixed collection.
Points are not renderable until later actions assign the required position,
size, and fill properties.

Point creation does not assign a coordinate or scale. Position encodings create
and attach the appropriate semantic coordinate when needed.

The first omitted mark ID uses its semantic role: `"point"`, `"line"`,
`"bar"`, `"area"`, or `"rule"`. A second mark of the same type requires an explicit ID.
This keeps simple chains concise without creating hidden numbered resources.

## `editPointMark({ target?, shape })`

Change a point mark's constant shape without changing its data or encodings:

```javascript
const diamonds = program.editPointMark({
  target: "points",
  shape: "diamond"
});
```

`target` may be omitted when the current or only point mark is unambiguous.
Supported shapes are `circle`, `square`, `diamond`, the four directional
triangles, `plus`, `cross`, `star`, `hexagon`, and `wye`. All recipes preserve
the same logical target area. A constant edit is rejected when the mark already
has a field-driven shape encoding.

## `createAreaMark({ id?, data?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth? } = {})`

Create a semantic area mark backed by an initially empty path collection.
`data` defaults to current data, `fill` defaults to `"#4c78a8"`, and opacity
defaults to `0.2`. The fixed fill and opacity are graphical appearance.
`stroke` adds a constant path outline; its width defaults to `1`. A width without
a stroke is rejected.

An area becomes renderable after quantitative x and atomic `encodeYRange`
encodings exist. Optional `encodeGroup` creates one Z-closed filled path per
nominal group without creating a scale or legend. A density-derived dataset may
instead use value/density x and y encodings: the density axis is closed against
zero, while the value axis determines sample order. Both horizontal-density and
vertical-density orientations are supported.

## `editAreaMark({ target?, fill?, opacity?, stroke?, strokeWidth? })`

Edit constant area appearance without changing data, fields, grouping, scales,
or coordinates:

```javascript
const outlined = program.editAreaMark({
  target: "densities",
  opacity: 0.35,
  stroke: "#334155",
  strokeWidth: 1.5
});
```

The current or only compatible area is inferred when `target` is omitted.
`stroke: false` removes both the outline and its stored width. A width-only edit
requires an active outline. Constant `fill` cannot replace a field-driven color
encoding, while opacity and outline remain independently editable. Complete
areas rematerialize immediately; incomplete areas retain the graphical config.

## `createLineMark({ id?, data?, strokeWidth?, curve? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first line mark defaults to `"line"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |
| `strokeWidth` | non-negative finite number | materializer default `2` |
| `curve` | supported curve interpolation | `"linear"` |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createLineMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `line`. Its graphical realization starts as an empty
`path` collection because series cardinality depends on later grouping
encodings rather than raw dataset length.

```javascript
program.graphicSpec.objects.line;
// { type: "path", children: [] }
```

Line mark creation does not infer one default series, coordinates, encodings,
or path commands. Temporal `encodeX` resolves the horizontal scale while leaving
the collection empty. Aggregate line `encodeY` then derives the currently known
series, resizes the collection, and materializes sorted concrete commands.
`encodeColor` and `encodeStrokeDash` can further regroup those paths and apply
semantic series styles. Regression-derived quantitative x/y values may be
materialized directly without temporal aggregation.

`curve` accepts `linear`, `step`, `step-before`, `step-after`, `basis`,
`cardinal`, `monotone`, and `natural`. Linear and step curves materialize `L`
commands; smooth curves materialize cubic `C` commands. Smooth curves with only
two points fall back to linear. A monotone curve requires strictly increasing
materialized x values.

## `editLineMark({ target?, strokeWidth?, curve? })`

Edit line appearance without changing fields, grouping, coordinates, or scales:

```javascript
const smooth = program.editLineMark({
  target: "trends",
  curve: "monotone",
  strokeWidth: 4
});
```

`target` may be omitted for the current or only line mark. At least one of
`strokeWidth` and `curve` is required. A complete line is rematerialized
immediately; an incomplete line retains the choice until its encodings make it
renderable. Canvas resizing and later series regrouping preserve both settings.

## `createBarMark({ id?, data? } = {})`

| Option | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | valid user-defined ID | first bar mark defaults to `"bar"` |
| `data` | existing dataset ID | current dataset |

```javascript
const program = chart()
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createBarMark();
```

The semantic mark type is `bar`. Its graphical realization starts as an empty
`rect` collection because binning, aggregation, stacking, and optional grouping
determine the eventual rectangle count.

```javascript
program.graphicSpec.objects.bar;
// { type: "rect", children: [] }
```

Bar mark creation does not assign coordinates, encodings, bins, or concrete
rectangles. A subsequent binned `encodeX` can store the horizontal histogram
meaning and resolve its scale. `encodeY()` then infers count/zero-stack meaning
and resolves its scale, then materializes one concrete rectangle per non-empty
bin.

`encodeColor({ field, layout? })` can then split each non-empty bin into category
rects. The color scale domain controls series order. Stack uses total bin counts,
fill normalizes to one, group creates within-bin slots, overlay shares a baseline,
and diverging separates positive and negative accumulation.

## `createRuleMark({ id?, data? } = {})`

Create a semantic rule mark backed by an empty backend-neutral `line`
collection. The first omitted ID is `"rule"`; `data` defaults to current data.
Creation assigns no position or style.

Use `encodeX` or `encodeY` for a full plot-span rule. Add `encodeY2` for a
bounded vertical interval, `encodeX2` for a bounded horizontal interval, or
both secondary endpoints for a diagonal rule. Each endpoint accepts either a
field or a datum. Constant stroke and width use `encodeStroke` and
`encodeStrokeWidth`; dash and opacity reuse their existing encoding actions.

Every complete rule is stored as concrete `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` values.
An incomplete intermediate endpoint combination stays empty until a later
assignment completes it. Canvas and scale edits recompute all endpoints.

## Errors and limitations

Mark IDs must be unique and the selected dataset must exist. If a mark type
already exists, another mark of that type requires an explicit ID. Current
semantic marks are point, line, bar, area, and rule; additional mark types are not
implemented.
