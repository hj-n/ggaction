# Marks

Marks define the semantic form of a layer. Create a mark first, then connect it
to data through position, grouping, and appearance encodings. The first mark of
each type infers its ID and current dataset when those choices are unambiguous.

## Choose a mark family

<div class="docs-entry-grid docs-entry-grid--two">
  <a href="./marks/point/">
    <strong>Point marks</strong>
    <span>Scatterplots, symbols, field-driven shape, size, and opacity.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="./marks/line-area/">
    <strong>Line and area marks</strong>
    <span>Ordered paths, grouped series, ranged areas, and density geometry.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="./marks/bar/">
    <strong>Bar marks</strong>
    <span>Histograms, aggregate bars, grouped layouts, and observed intervals.</span>
  </a>
  <a href="./marks/rule/">
    <strong>Rule marks</strong>
    <span>Full-span references, bounded intervals, and diagonal endpoints.</span>
  </a>
</div>

## At a glance

| Family | Create | Edit | Initial graphic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Point | `createPointMark` | `editPointMark` | Point collection |
| Line | `createLineMark` | `editLineMark` | Path collection |
| Area | `createAreaMark` | `editAreaMark` | Closed path collection |
| Bar | `createBarMark` | `editBarMark` | Rect collection |
| Rule | `createRuleMark` | Encoding actions | Line collection |

Creation establishes semantic ownership but may leave an empty collection.
Concrete graphics appear when the required encodings make the mark renderable.
Later Canvas, scale, grouping, or appearance edits explicitly rematerialize
those graphics.

## Shared inference

- `data` defaults to the current dataset.
- The first omitted mark ID uses the semantic role: `"point"`, `"line"`,
  `"area"`, `"bar"`, or `"rule"`.
- A second mark of the same type requires an explicit ID.
- A newly layered mark can inherit compatible data, coordinate, x, and y
  encodings from one unambiguous source layer.
- Mark-specific aggregate, bin, stack, and appearance policies are never copied
  implicitly.
