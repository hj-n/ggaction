# Getting Started

{% include getting-started-chart.html %}

This walkthrough installs `ggaction`, creates a complete scatterplot from an
inline dataset, and renders it to Browser Canvas. Every action returns a new
immutable `ChartProgram`, so the calls can be chained.

## 1. Create a browser project

`ggaction` is an ESM package. This minimal setup uses Vite to resolve the npm
package for the browser:

```bash
mkdir ggaction-start
cd ggaction-start
npm init -y
npm install ggaction
npm install --save-dev vite
```

The command installs the public `ggaction` package from the npm registry.

Create `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ggaction scatterplot</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="chart" aria-label="Scatterplot of horsepower versus mileage by origin">
      Scatterplot of horsepower versus mileage by origin.
    </canvas>
    <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Build the program

Create `main.js`:

```javascript
import { chart, render } from "ggaction/basic";

const cars = [
  { horsepower: 88, mpg: 27, origin: "USA" },
  { horsepower: 70, mpg: 36, origin: "Japan" },
  { horsepower: 110, mpg: 24, origin: "Europe" }
];

const program = chart()
  .createCanvas({
    width: 640,
    height: 400,
    margin: { top: 30, right: 130, bottom: 60, left: 70 }
  })
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createScatterPlot({
    x: "horsepower",
    y: "mpg",
    color: "origin",
    shape: "origin",
    guides: {
      axes: {
        x: { title: { text: "Horsepower" } },
        y: { title: { text: "Miles per gallon" } }
      }
    }
  });

const canvas = document.querySelector("#chart");
render(program, canvas.getContext("2d"));
```

`createScatterPlot` uses the current dataset to create the point mark, x and y
positions, scales, and applicable guides. Matching nominal color and shape
encodings also create a composite legend and a redundant visual cue, so origin
is recognizable without color alone. The right margin reserves room for that
legend.

Pass `data` when more than one dataset could apply, or `id` when a later edit
must name this mark. To understand how these calls remain immutable and
inspectable, continue with
<a href="{{ '/concepts/chart-program/' | relative_url }}">ChartProgram</a>,
<a href="{{ '/concepts/semantic-and-graphics/' | relative_url }}">semantic and graphical state</a>,
and <a href="{{ '/concepts/actions-and-trace/' | relative_url }}">action traces</a>.

This walkthrough uses the creation-focused `ggaction/basic` entry. Import from
`ggaction` instead when the program needs editing, selection, composition,
Polar or Parallel coordinates, or statistical layers.

## 3. Run it

```bash
npx vite
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. The browser draws the chart into the Canvas
created in `index.html`.

## Package entries and compatibility

| Import | Environment | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ggaction` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Complete chart authoring and Browser Canvas rendering |
| `ggaction/basic` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Smaller creation path for scatter, line, bar, histogram, and heatmap charts |
| `ggaction/extension` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Wrapped actions and public primitive authoring |
| `ggaction/png` | Node.js 20+ only | PNG file output through the native Canvas adapter |
| `ggaction/pdf` | Node.js 20+ only | Single-page vector PDF file output |
| `ggaction/svg` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Complete SVG document string output |

All entries include TypeScript declarations. The package does not publish
CommonJS entry points. Import `ggaction/png` and `ggaction/pdf` only from Node
code; the browser-safe entries, including `ggaction/svg`, do not load filesystem
or native output modules.

The release artifact is tested by installing its exact tarball into fresh
JavaScript and TypeScript consumer projects. It is also tested in a browser and
across the supported Node release matrix.

## Runnable repository examples

Use the
[generated repository example index](https://github.com/ggaction/ggaction/blob/main/examples/README.md)
for complete runnable modules. Browse the
<a href="{{ '/gallery/' | relative_url }}">chart gallery</a> for visual examples,
or use
the [Quarto and Observable JS example](https://github.com/ggaction/ggaction/tree/main/examples/quarto-ojs/)
when authoring an `.qmd` document.
