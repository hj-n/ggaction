# Getting Started

{% include chart-example.html id="scatterplot" %}

This walkthrough installs `ggaction`, creates a complete scatterplot from an
inline dataset, and renders it to Browser Canvas. Every action returns a new
immutable `ChartProgram`, so the calls can be chained.

## 1. Create a browser project

`ggaction` is an ESM package. This minimal setup uses Vite to resolve the npm
package for the browser:

```bash
mkdir ggaction-start
cd ggaction-start
npm init -y
npm install ggaction
npm install --save-dev vite
```

The command installs the public `ggaction` package from the npm registry.

Create `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ggaction scatterplot</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="chart" aria-label="Horsepower versus mileage"></canvas>
    <script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Build the program

Create `main.js`:

```javascript
import { chart, render } from "ggaction";

const cars = [
  { horsepower: 88, mpg: 27, origin: "USA" },
  { horsepower: 70, mpg: 36, origin: "Japan" },
  { horsepower: 110, mpg: 24, origin: "Europe" }
];

const program = chart()
  .createCanvas({
    width: 640,
    height: 400,
    margin: { top: 30, right: 130, bottom: 60, left: 70 }
  })
  .createData({ values: cars })
  .createScatterPlot({
    x: "horsepower",
    y: "mpg",
    color: "origin",
    shape: "origin",
    guides: {
      axes: {
        x: { title: { text: "Horsepower" } },
        y: { title: { text: "Miles per gallon" } }
      }
    }
  });

const canvas = document.querySelector("#chart");
render(program, canvas.getContext("2d"));
```

`createScatterPlot` uses the current dataset, creates a point mark, assigns the
x, y, and optional appearance encodings, and creates applicable guides. It
records those regular actions as trace children rather than compiling a second
chart specification. Pass `data` explicitly when a program contains more than
one dataset candidate; pass `id` when a later multi-resource flow needs that
mark identity.

The wrapped `createGuides` action infers the applicable axes and horizontal
grid from the position encodings. Matching nominal color and shape encodings
also create a composite categorical legend, giving each origin a redundant
visual cue; the right margin reserves space for that legend. The renderer reads
only concrete `graphicSpec` values already produced by actions; it does not
compile `semanticSpec` during rendering.

## 3. Run it

```bash
npx vite
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. The browser draws the chart into the Canvas
created in `index.html`.

## Package entries and compatibility

| Import | Environment | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ggaction` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Chart authoring and Browser Canvas rendering |
| `ggaction/extension` | Modern ESM browsers and Node.js 20+ | Wrapped actions and public primitive authoring |
| `ggaction/png` | Node.js 20+ only | PNG file output through the native Canvas adapter |

All entries include TypeScript declarations. The package does not publish
CommonJS entry points. Import `ggaction/png` only from Node code; the default
browser entry does not load filesystem or native PNG modules.

The release artifact is tested by installing its exact tarball into fresh
JavaScript and TypeScript consumer projects. It is also tested in a browser and
across the supported Node release matrix.
