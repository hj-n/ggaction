# Supported Features

This page describes implemented behavior only. A dash means that the current
chart-authoring API does not support that combination.

## Complete chart support

Every chart family below supports Browser Canvas, browser-safe SVG, Node PNG,
single-page vector PDF, and an optional chart title. The smaller family tables
keep the comparison readable on narrow screens.

### Cartesian charts

The complete `createScatterPlot`, `createLinePlot`, `createBarPlot`,
`createHistogram`, and pre-gridded or raw-row binned `createHeatmap` facades compose the same
mark, encoding, scale, and guide actions described below. Individual actions
remain available for custom layering and editing.

Basic chart facades infer only a current or unique dataset and stable unused
role IDs. Ambiguous data or an occupied default role requires an explicit ID.
Complete chart facades create applicable guides by default and accept
`guides: false`. `createBoxPlot` preserves its historical opt-in behavior:
pass `guides: {}` or nested options to create applicable guides.

## Current limitations

### Data, transforms, and heatmaps

Transforms beyond the documented filters, regressions, density and interval
derivations, as well as interactive legends, are not implemented.
Pre-gridded heatmaps do not synthesize missing cells. Binned heatmaps support
fixed rectangular bins only; weighted, adaptive, hexagonal, and overflow bins
are not implemented. Cell text must be added as a separate text layer.

### Guides and interval charts

Categorical legends support all four edges; point composite and size legends
support right and left side layouts.
Error bars support vertical and horizontal statistical intervals, existing
center/lower/upper fields, optional caps, and constant rule appearance.
Error bands support vertical and horizontal statistical or explicit ranges and
optional lower/upper boundary lines with shared stroke, width, dash, opacity,
and inherited or overridden curve. Independent lower/upper style objects are
not implemented.

### Distribution charts

Box plots support vertical or horizontal category/measure pairings, default
or configurable Tukey summaries, min–max whiskers, band width and component
appearance overrides, and explicit outlier opt-out without placeholder resources.
Gradient plots support the same category/measure orientation family, immutable
sampled profile revisions, configurable density/width/paint/center options,
source-first filtering, category-strip highlighting, and Cartesian facet
replay. Shared facet density legends and partial composite `filterMarks` are
not implemented.
Violin plots support the same category/measure orientation family, symmetric
full profiles, one-sided placement, two-value split halves, shared or
category-local density width, density revision, source filtering, profile
selection/highlighting, Cartesian facet replay, and compatible overlay scales.
Raincloud components, more than two split values, adaptive bandwidth, and
Polar violin placement are not implemented.

### Selection, appearance, and text

Mark selection supports point, final-bar item, stacked-bar group, line/area
series, arc sector, and rule grain. Selector values explicitly distinguish data fields,
pre-scale semantic channels, and concrete graphic properties.
Highlight appearance supports point fill/shape/size/outline/offset, bar fill and
outline, area/arc fill/outline/offset, and line/rule stroke/width/dash/offset.
Cartesian point jitter supports deterministic pixel offsets and categorical
band-relative offsets. It preserves semantic channel values, remains bounded
by glyph extent and plot/category slots, and does not perform collision-free
packing. Polar point jitter is not implemented.
Text marks support deterministic collision-aware displacement along x, y, or
both axes within plot or Canvas bounds. The policy can create ordinary leader
lines, replays after text/source/data/scale/Canvas edits, and records structured
warnings when bounded placement cannot eliminate every overlap. It does not
expand margins, shrink text, arrange guide labels, or search unrelated marks
for anchors.

### Coordinates and composition

Polar charts may be direct or nested concat children. Faceting a Polar source is
not implemented and fails before partial child state is created.
Parallel coordinates support quantitative/ordinal dimensions, open linear
paths, dimension-local axes, color/stroke-dash legends, selection and filtering.
Temporal dimensions, curved paths, axis drag reordering, brushing, bundling,
faceting, and shared Parallel coordinates across child programs are not implemented.
