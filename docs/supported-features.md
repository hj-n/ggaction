# Supported Features

This page describes implemented behavior only. A dash means that the current
chart-authoring API does not support that combination.

## Complete chart support

| Capability | Scatterplot | Line chart | Histogram | Bar chart | Regression scatterplot | Density area | Error bar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic mark | point | line | bar | bar | point + area + line | area | rule |
| Position | quantitative x/y | temporal x, aggregate y | binned x, count y | ordinal x, aggregate y | shared quantitative x/y | value + density x/y | categorical/temporal x, interval y |
| Nominal color | point fill | series stroke | five bar layouts | five bar layouts | point fill + fit stroke | overlay/stack/fill/diverging area | — |
| Stroke dash | — | nominal or constant; 4 named styles | — | — | — | — | fixed solid |
| Constant appearance | radius | stroke width, 8 curves | — | band or logical-pixel width | opacity, band fill, line width | opacity | fixed rule and 8px caps |
| Automatic axes | linear | UTC time and linear | bin-aligned and linear | ordinal and linear | shared linear | source value + density | categorical/temporal x and linear y |
| Automatic grid | horizontal | horizontal | horizontal | horizontal | shared horizontal | horizontal; vertical optional | horizontal |
| Legend | point color + shape | categorical | categorical | categorical | composite color/shape/line + size | categorical top/right/bottom | — |

## Shared foundations

| Area | Supported now |
| --- | --- |
| Program model | Immutable `ChartProgram`, hierarchical action trace |
| Canvas | Create/edit width, height, background, margin |
| Data | Immutable arrays of plain row objects, named filters, grouped interval summaries, grouped linear/polynomial/LOESS regression, and grouped kernel-density derivations |
| Coordinates | Named Cartesian and Polar semantic resources; x/y use Cartesian |
| Scales | Linear, UTC time, ordinal position, color, named/direct stroke dash, and padded band-local xOffset |
| Aggregates | count, sum, mean, median, min/max, distinct/valid/missing, sample/population dispersion, quartiles, standard error, normal 95% mean endpoints, parameterized quantile, and ordered first/last |
| Guides | Automatic bottom/top x axes, left/right y axes, closed numeric/UTC label formats, independently editable horizontal/vertical Cartesian grids, and editable four-edge continuous/left-right categorical legends |
| Titles | One four-edge title with an optional subtitle, deterministic word/character wrapping, and partial editing |
| Rendering | Browser Canvas and Node PNG |
| Graphics | Concrete canvas, circle, line, rect, text, `M/L/C/Z` command paths, 8 line curves, and heterogeneous drawable collections |

## Current limitations

Polar guide graphics, transforms beyond the documented filters, regressions,
and density derivations, facets, interactive legends, and program composition
are not implemented.
Categorical legends support all four edges; point composite and size legends
support right and left side layouts.
Error bars currently support vertical statistical intervals only; horizontal,
explicit-field, cap-removal, and custom-style variants are not implemented.
