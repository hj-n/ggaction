Public bar color encoding and automatic histogram legend generation are not
yet implemented. Polar guide graphics, additional mark types, public
transforms, facets, additional legend types or positions, and program
composition are also not implemented in the current release. Additional title
positions, automatic text wrapping, and text measurement are unsupported.
These features are not part of the current API reference.
