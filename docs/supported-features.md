# Supported Features

This page describes implemented behavior only. A dash means that the current
chart-authoring API does not support that combination.

## Complete chart support

| Capability | Scatterplot | Line chart | Histogram | Bar chart | Regression scatterplot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic mark | point | line | bar | bar | point + area + line |
| Position | quantitative x/y | temporal x, mean y | binned x, count y | ordinal x, mean y | shared quantitative x/y |
| Nominal color | point fill | series stroke | zero-stacked fill | grouped fill and xOffset | point fill + fit stroke |
| Stroke dash | — | nominal series | — | — | — |
| Constant appearance | radius | — | — | band width | opacity, band fill, line width |
| Automatic axes | linear | UTC time and linear | bin-aligned and linear | ordinal and linear | shared linear |
| Automatic grid | horizontal | horizontal | horizontal | horizontal | shared horizontal |
| Legend | point color + shape | categorical | categorical | categorical | composite color/shape/line + size |
| Chart title | optional | optional | optional | optional | optional |
| Browser Canvas | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Node PNG | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Shared foundations

| Area | Supported now |
| --- | --- |
| Program model | Immutable `ChartProgram`, hierarchical action trace |
| Canvas | Create/edit width, height, background, margin |
| Data | Immutable arrays of plain row objects, named filters, and grouped linear-regression derivations |
| Coordinates | Named Cartesian and Polar semantic resources; x/y use Cartesian |
| Scales | Linear, UTC time, ordinal position, color, stroke dash, and band-local xOffset |
| Guides | Automatic axes, horizontal/vertical Cartesian grids, and categorical legends |
| Titles | One plot-aligned top title with one optional single-line subtitle |
| Rendering | Browser Canvas and Node PNG |
| Graphics | Concrete canvas, circle, line, rect, text, open/closed point-array paths, and heterogeneous drawable collections |

## Current limitations

Polar guide graphics, transforms beyond named filters and linear regression,
facets, interactive legends, and program composition are not implemented.
Additional title positions, automatic text wrapping, and text measurement are
also unsupported. Categorical legends support right and bottom placement;
point composite and size legends currently use the right-side layout.
