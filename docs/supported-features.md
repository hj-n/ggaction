# Supported Features

This page describes implemented behavior only. A dash means that the current
chart-authoring API does not support that combination.

## Complete chart support

Every chart family below supports Browser Canvas, Node PNG, and an optional
chart title. The smaller family tables keep the comparison readable on narrow
screens.

### Cartesian charts

| Capability | Scatterplot | Line | Histogram | Bar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic mark | point | line | bar | bar |
| Position | quantitative x/y | temporal x, aggregate y | binned x, count y | ordinal x, aggregate y |
| Nominal color | point fill | series stroke | five bar layouts | five bar layouts |
| Stroke dash | — | nominal or constant; 4 named styles | — | — |
| Appearance | radius | stroke width, 8 curves | default bar geometry | band or logical-pixel width |
| Automatic guides | linear axes; horizontal grid | UTC time/linear axes; horizontal grid | bin-aligned/linear axes; horizontal grid | ordinal/linear axes; horizontal grid |
| Legend | point color + shape | categorical | categorical | categorical |
| Selection/highlight | point | series | final bar | final bar |

### Statistical layers

| Capability | Regression scatterplot | Density area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic marks | point + area + line | area |
| Position | shared quantitative x/y | value + density x/y |
| Nominal color | point fill + fit stroke | overlay/stack/fill/diverging area |
| Appearance | point opacity, band fill/outline, line width, 8 curves | opacity, 8 curves |
| Automatic guides | shared linear axes and horizontal grid | source-value/density axes; horizontal grid, vertical optional |
| Legend | composite color/shape/line + size | categorical top/right/bottom |
| Selection/highlight | layer selection + point highlight | series |

### Intervals and distributions

| Capability | Error bar | Error band | Box plot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic marks | rule | area | bar + rule + point |
| Position | categorical/temporal independent axis; interval on the other | quantitative/temporal independent axis; x/x2 or y/y2 interval | categorical axis; quantitative interval axis |
| Nominal color | — | grouped area fill | body fill through ranged-bar color |
| Appearance | stroke, width, dash, opacity, optional caps | fill, opacity, 8 curves, styled boundaries | fixed defaults; 1.5px median/whiskers |
| Automatic guides | interval and independent axes; perpendicular grid | interval and independent axes; perpendicular grid | categorical/linear axes; horizontal grid |
| Legend | — | categorical | optional ranged-bar color legend |
| Selection/highlight | rule | series | component |

### Polar charts

| Capability | Polar points | Polar line / radar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Semantic mark | point | line |
| Position | theta/radius | theta/radius |
| Nominal color | point fill | series stroke |
| Stroke dash | — | nominal or constant; 4 named styles |
| Appearance | radius, opacity, shape | stroke width, opacity, open/closed |
| Automatic guides | theta outer axis, radial axis, spokes, circles | theta outer axis, radial axis, spokes, circles |
| Legend | point color + shape | categorical |
| Selection/highlight | point | series |

## Shared foundations

| Area | Supported now |
| --- | --- |
| Program model | Immutable `ChartProgram`, hierarchical action trace |
| Canvas | Create/edit width, height, background, margin |
| Data | Immutable arrays of plain row objects, named filters, grouped interval summaries, grouped linear/polynomial/LOESS regression, and grouped kernel-density derivations |
| Coordinates | Named Cartesian and Polar resources; x/y use Cartesian and theta/radius use Polar for points and lines |
| Scales | Linear/log/pow/sqrt/symlog position across compatible marks, UTC time, band/point position, ordinal/sequential/quantize/quantile/threshold color, point-item unknown fallbacks, named/direct stroke dash, and padded band-local xOffset |
| Aggregates | count, sum, mean, median, min/max, distinct/valid/missing, sample/population dispersion, quartiles, standard error, normal 95% mean endpoints, parameterized quantile, and ordered first/last |
| Guides | Automatic Cartesian x/y and Polar theta/radius axes, closed numeric/UTC label formats, independently editable Cartesian and Polar grids, editable four-edge continuous/left-right categorical legends, and right-side interval legends |
| Titles | One four-edge title with an optional subtitle, deterministic word/character wrapping, and partial editing |
| Rendering | Browser Canvas and Node PNG |
| Graphics | Concrete canvas, circle, line, rect, text, `M/L/C/Z` command paths, shared 8-value line/area curves, and heterogeneous drawable collections |
| Selection | Strict point/bar/series/rule comparison, set, range and grouped rank; reusable selection state; mark-specific highlight/dimming/front order |

## Current limitations

Polar arc marks, transforms beyond the documented filters, regressions,
and density derivations, facets, interactive legends, and program composition
are not implemented.
Categorical legends support all four edges; point composite and size legends
support right and left side layouts.
Error bars support vertical and horizontal statistical intervals, existing
center/lower/upper fields, optional caps, and constant rule appearance.
Error bands support vertical and horizontal statistical or explicit ranges and
optional lower/upper boundary lines with shared stroke, width, dash, opacity,
and inherited or overridden curve. Independent lower/upper style objects are
not implemented.
Box plots support vertical or horizontal category/measure pairings, default
or configurable Tukey summaries, min–max whiskers, band width and component
appearance overrides, and explicit outlier opt-out without placeholder resources.
Mark selection supports point, final-bar item, stacked-bar group, line/area
series, and rule grain. Selector values explicitly distinguish data fields,
pre-scale semantic channels, and concrete graphic properties.
Highlight appearance supports point fill/shape/size/outline/offset, bar fill and
outline, area fill/outline/offset, and line/rule stroke/width/dash/offset.
