# ggaction Documentation

`ggaction` models chart authoring as a sequence of immutable actions while
retaining both semantic intent and fully materialized graphics.

> **Current status:** Canvas, immutable data, semantic point marks, quantitative
> x/y/color encodings, constant radius, hierarchical action traces, and Canvas rendering for concrete
> canvas, circle, line, and text graphics are implemented.
