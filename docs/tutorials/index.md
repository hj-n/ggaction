# Tutorials

Build complete charts before exploring individual API options.

| Chart | Semantic mark | Core actions | Example result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scatterplot | point | `encodeX`, `encodeY`, `encodeColor` | Quantitative points |
| Line chart | line | temporal `encodeX`, aggregate `encodeY` | Mean series over time |
| Histogram | bar | `encodeHistogram`, stacked `encodeColor` | Binned counts |
| Bar chart | bar | ordinal `encodeX`, aggregate `encodeY`, grouped `encodeColor` | Side-by-side aggregate bars |

Choose the chart whose semantic relationship matches the question you want to
answer. The bar tutorial uses grouped bars as its current example; grouping is
a layout choice, not a separate top-level chart type.

## Scatterplot

Create quantitative x/y positions, nominal color, constant point radius, and
Cartesian axes from the cars dataset.

[Build the cars scatterplot](./scatterplot.md)

## Aggregate line chart

Create temporal mean-aggregate series, combine color and stroke dash in one
legend, and add a chart title.

[Build the cars line chart](./line-chart.md)

## Stacked histogram

Bin a quantitative field, count and stack rows by category, infer histogram
guides, and center a chart title.

[Build the cars histogram](./histogram.md)

## Bar chart

Aggregate an ordinal x category and build a bar chart. The current example uses
a nominal color field to place groups side by side.
